        <p>80% of data is buried deep in unstructured, scattered, and constantly changing formats (e.g., websites, PDFs, emails, PPTX, etc.) that are hard to access and analyze.</p>
        <p>Enterprises spend billions of dollars on processing this kind of data, often missing out on valuable insights from sources that are too complex or costly to process with existing tools.</p>
        <p>AI should automate such tedious work, and that's why we picked this hard and boring problem. We're only scratching the surface of what's possible with unstructured data.</p>
        <p>Our platform automates the entire data pipeline, from extraction to transformation and integration.</p>
